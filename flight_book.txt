---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Airline Reservation System aims to automate the flight ticketing/seat booking
and confirmation system of an Airline company. The software is providing options for
viewing different flights available at different timing for a specific day. That provides
customers within the facility with the ability to book tickets smoothly. The customers can
modify and are able to cancel the ticket for any reason. That prepares within a role and
policies. The software should provide an option for checking the availability of the tickets.
That is important for the customers to get messages if the ticket is unavailable. That will be
displayed to customers. The customers should be noted when the change has been made or
any further changes. He or she can book accommodation if required.

Note:
Use of C language concepts such as pointers, dynamic array using DMA(no-memory leak), advanced pointers such as double pointer, function pointer, static library, macro constant, macro function, macro oprators, conditional preprocessor, binary file streams, linked list, mutli threading (threads, RACE FIX, MUTEX, COND VAR).
